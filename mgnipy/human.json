Dysbiosis has been studied extensively but typically characterized cross-sectionally and as alterations in bacterial taxonomic proportions.  The longitudinal contributions of diet, antibiotic use, and inflammation on the evolution of dysbiosis during therapy for Crohn's disease have not been well characterized. Here we used shot-gun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples collected from a longitudinal prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease subjects to analyze the representation and gene content of all types of organisms present, including bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses.  Patients initiated treated with either antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha or enteral nutrition per the treating physician.  Multivariate analysis showed that microbiome composition was associated with three environmental stressors--intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and diet.  Bacterial gene signatures suggested that communities in Crohn's samples were responding to oxidative stress. Antibiotic use was associated with a more dysbiotic composition of the bacterial microbiota as well as a distinctive increase in fungal organisms and human DNA content. In contrast, the abundance of tailed phage and archaea was similar in feces of children with Crohn's disease and healthy controls.  Composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were highly correlated. Dysbiosis in bacterial and fungal communities was reduced in patients with reduction of intestinal inflammation by either therapy. Diet had an independent and rapid effect on gut microbiota composition within one week of initiation. Evidently dysbiosis characteristic of Crohn's disease results in part from inflammation and antibiotic use, and involves correlated changes in bacterial and eukaryotic community members.  Notably, the three stressors were independently associated with different bacteria and different gene pathways, reflecting concurrent disruption of normal homeostasis by multiple mechanisms. Thus, while dysbiosis in general is common to multiple disease states, the nature of the dysbiosis is unique to the environmental stressor.","study-name":"Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Concurrent Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2019-05-14T09:59:32"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00004712","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB28097","samples-count":4945,"accession":"MGYS00004712","secondary-accession":"ERP110263","centre-name":"WEIZMANN INSTITUE OF SCIENCE","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Abstract (1):Empiric probiotics are commonly consumed in healthy individuals as means of life quality improvement and disease prevention. However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo, demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured a person-, region- and microbial-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by differential baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, highly-individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.Abstract (2):Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa, but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently-incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and gut transcriptome recovery to steady-state configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In-vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised microbiome and host recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection, without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.","study-name":"(1) Personalized microbiome and host features resist gut mucosal colonization by empiric probiotics; (2) Post-antibiotic gut mucosal microbiome reconstitution is impaired by probiotics and improved by autologous FMT","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2019-05-08T11:37:39"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00004399","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA304249","samples-count":73,"accession":"MGYS00004399","secondary-accession":"SRP067029","centre-name":"BioProject","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"In the present study, Sediment bacterial communities in monospecific stands of four habitats (mudflats and mono-specific plots of the seagrass Zostera noltei and the saltmarsh plants Juncus maritimus and Spartina maritima) were investigated.","study-name":"Shallow coastal lagoon Metagenome","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2019-04-06T07:50:56"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004399/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004399/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004399/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004399/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004399/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004399/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004399"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00003911","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB14782","samples-count":93,"accession":"MGYS00003911","secondary-accession":"ERP016451","centre-name":"UCSDMI","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Whole grains contain numerous physiologically bioactive compounds, a key group being polyphenolic compounds (such as ferulic acid).

Recent reports in humans and animal models have demonstrated the beneficial therapeutic effects of infections by parasitic worms (helminths) in some inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and coeliac disease (CeD). Interestingly, these studies have described how helminths may alter the intestinal microbiota, potentially representing a mechanism by which they regulate inflammation. However, for practical reasons, these reports have primarily analysed the fecal microbiota. In the present investigation, we have assessed, for the first time, the changes in the microbiota at the site of infection by a parasitic helminth (hookworm) and gluten-dependent inflammation in humans with CeD using biopsy tissue from the duodenum. Our results demonstrate that hookworm infection and gluten exposure were associated with increases in the richness and diversity of the tissue-resident microbiota within the intestine. This may represent one mechanism by which these parasites may restore intestinal immune homeostasis and exert a therapeutic benefit in CeD, and potentially other inflammatory disorders.","study-name":"Changes in duodenal tissue-associated microbiota following hookworm infection and consecutive gluten challenges in humans with coeliac disease","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-10-11T11:39:13"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003180/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003180/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003180/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003180/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003180/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003180/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003180"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00003148","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB28700","samples-count":56,"accession":"MGYS00003148","secondary-accession":"ERP110943","centre-name":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"A comprehensive analysis of the faecal microbiome and metabolome of Strongyloides stercoralis infected volunteers from a non-endemic area","study-name":"A comprehensive analysis of the faecal microbiome and metabolome of Strongyloides stercoralis infected volunteers from a non-endemic area","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-10-04T11:55:12"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003148/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003148/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003148/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003148/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003148/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003148/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003148"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00003147","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB21999","samples-count":35,"accession":"MGYS00003147","secondary-accession":"ERP024316","centre-name":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRDGE","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Investigations of the impact that patent infections by soil-transmitted gastrointestinal nematode parasites exert on the composition of the host gut commensal flora are attracting growing interest by the scientific community. However, information collected to date varies across experiments, and further studies are needed to identify consistent relationships between parasites and commensal microbial species. Here, we explore the qualitative and quantitative differences between the microbial community profiles of cohorts of human volunteers from Sri Lanka with patent infection by one or more parasitic nematode species (H+), as well as that of uninfected subjects (H-) and of volunteers who had been subjected to regular prophylactic anthelmintic treatment (Ht). High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, followed by bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of sequence data revealed no significant differences in alpha diversity (Shannon) and richness between groups (P = 0.65, P = 0.13 respectively); however, beta diversity was significantly increased in H+ and Ht when individually compared to H-volunteers (P = 0.04). Among others, bacteria of the families Verrucomicrobiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae showed a trend towards increased abundance in H+, whereas the Leuconostocaceae and Bacteroidaceae showed a relative increase in H- and Ht respectively. Our findings add valuable knowledge to the vast, and yet little explored, research field of parasite – microbiota interactions and will provide a basis for the elucidation of the role such interactions play in pathogenic and immune-modulatory properties of parasitic nematodes in both human and animal hosts.","study-name":"Infections by human gastrointestinal helminths are associated with changes in faecal microbiota diversity and composition","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-10-04T11:23:20"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00003135","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB1781","samples-count":1,"accession":"MGYS00003135","secondary-accession":"ERP002465","centre-name":"SC","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Materials and Methods: We carried out the study in two rural communities \nin Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador.

This generated 999,796 \nsequences, which were processed and analysed using mothur.\n\nResults: Microbiota analyses were done using stool samples from 97 \nchildren aged 8-14 years of whom 30 were not infected, 17 were infected \nwith T. trichiura alone, and 50 had mixed infections with both T. \ntrichiura and A. lumbricoides. Post-treatment samples were analyzed for \n14 of the 17 children initially infected with T. trichiura alone and 21 \nof 30 uninfected children. Treatment resulted in 100% cure of STH \ninfections. Comparisons of the microbiota at different taxonomic levels \nshowed no statistically significant differences in composition between \nuninfected children and those with T. trichiura infections. A surprising \nfinding was a decreased proportional abundance of a few bacterial genera \nfrom the clostridia class of Firmicutes, in tandem with a reduced \noverall bacterial diversity, among children with mixed infections \ncompared to either uninfected children or those with T. trichiura \ninfections only, indicating a specific effect of A. lumbricoides \ninfection on intestinal microbiota.  Anthelmintic treatment of children \nwith T. trichiura did not appear to alter composition of faecal microbiota.\n\nDiscussion: This is the first molecular study to analyse the effect of \nwhipworm infection on the human intestinal microbiota. Our data indicate \nthat T. trichiura infections alone have no effect on the faecal \nmicrobiota of children living in endemic communities, but that A. \nlumbricoides colonisation might be associated with a disturbed \nmicrobiota. Our results also catalogue the microbiota that is present in \nrural Ecuadorians, and indicate that there are differences between this \ncohort and individuals from more urban, industrialised societies.","study-name":"Human_infections_with_the_whipworm__Trichuris_trichiura__are_not_associated_with_alterations_in_the_faecal_microbiota_","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-09-19T09:49:46"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002961","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB28237","samples-count":191,"accession":"MGYS00002961","secondary-accession":"ERP110418","centre-name":"CENTRE DE RECHERCHE EN INFECTIOLOGIE DE L'UNIVERSITE LAVAL","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"In this study, we used culture enrichment of stools to reveal lower abundance bacteria by high-throughput sequencing.

Sample types included oral and endotracheal swabs, stool and breast milk, collected from 7 patients over the first 2 months, postnatally (n = 158 samples). Propidium monoazide treatment was combined with targeted sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to identify viable bacterial communities. Significantly lower alpha diversity was observed in stool than upstream mucosae (P < .005). Homogenising dispersal of dominant taxa was identified across all body-sites within the first week of life and persisted throughout the sampling period for all infants. Beta diversity was lowest immediately following birth and between proximal sampling sites. Oral microbiota showed the greatest similarity to stool (R2 = .73, P < 0.05), however the composition of stool microbiotas diverged from upstream mucosae over time (67% at WoL 1 vs 20% at WoL 8).

Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, (HSCT), i.e. a replacement of the cellular part of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut microbiota composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g. at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly. \n\nResults:\nIn two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) High concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and B cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.\n\nConclusions: \nWe identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the microbiome may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.","study-name":"Specific gut microbiome members are associated with distinct immune markers in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-06-29T08:41:19"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Circulatory system:Blood","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Circulatory%20system:Blood"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002436","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB24848","samples-count":92,"accession":"MGYS00002436","secondary-accession":"ERP106707","centre-name":"EMBL-EBI","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"The human gut metagenome Third Party Annotation (TPA) assembly was derived from the primary whole genome shotgun (WGS) data set: PRJNA290729.

Saliva was collected and dental health assessed in 33 children aged 4 years, and again 1-year later. The composition of the salivary microbiome was assessed and host defense peptides in saliva were quantified. Principle component analysis of the salivary microbiome indicated that children clustered by age and not disease status. Similarly, changes in salivary host defense peptides occurred with age and not in response to, or preceding dental caries. Partial least squares modelling of microbial, immunological and clinical baseline measures clustered children according to future dental disease status. These data demonstrate that isolated evaluation of the salivary microbiome or host response failed to predict dental disease. In contrast, combined assessment of both host response together with the microbiome revealed clusters of health and disease.

The development of techniques to exploit samples, which cannot be satisfactorily analysed at present, is driving the field.  High-throughput sequencing techniques have been available for a few years however there are very few examples of their application in forensic science.   This study investigates the potential for bacteria found in the salivary microbiome to be used in a new method for human identification. Two different targets (16S RNA and rpoB) were chosen to maximise coverage of the salivary microbiome and when combined, they increase the power of identification. Paired-end Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to analyse the bacterial composition of saliva from two different people at four different time points (t=0 and t=28 days and then one year later at t=0 and t=28 days).   Five major phyla dominate the samples: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Streptococcus, a firmicute, is one of the most abundant genera found in saliva and targeting Streptococcus rpoB has enabled a deeper characterisation of the different streptococci species otherwise impossible with 16S rRNA alone. We have observed that samples from the same person group together regardless of time of sampling. However, samples taken one month apart group closer together than those taken one year apart. The results indicate that it is possible to distinguish two people using the bacteria found in their saliva.","study-name":"Human identification through analysis of the salivary microbiome","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-04-26T09:58:58"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002359/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002359/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002359/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002359/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002359/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002359/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002359"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002358","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJDB4192","samples-count":44,"accession":"MGYS00002358","secondary-accession":"DRP003845","centre-name":"KYOTO_GM","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Eleven patients who have peri-implantitis and periodontitis were selected.

We characterized inter- and intra-individual variation of microbial communities in the largest cohort to date (264 saliva samples), using culture-independent 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. We followed the temporal dynamics of their salivary microbiota over 10 years spanning adolescence, and determined the influence of human genotype, gender, age, puberty, and weight class on the microbial communities. Participants included 107 healthy individuals sampled mainly at ages 12-13, 17-18 and 22-24, with a few sampled as early as 8 years of age. In contrast to gut or skin microbiomes, there is a core genus-level salivary microbiome; individuals are more similar to themselves and their co-twins in the 12-17 and in the 17-22 cohorts than to the whole sample population, but not over the 10 years from 12 to 22; and human genotype has no significant role in the oral bacterial composition. The data are most consistent with shared environment serving as the main determinant of microbial populations. Twins resemble each other more closely than the whole population at all time-points, but become less similar to each other when they age and no longer cohabit. Several organisms have age-specific abundance profiles, including members of the genera Veillonella, Actinomyces, and Streptococcus. There is no clear effect of weight class, puberty, and gender.

In supragingival plaque, after the addition of a carbohydrate source, bacteria rapidly decrease the pH which then subsequently recovers. In this project we studied gene transcription in naturally diverse saliva-derived in vitro grown biofilms as they were amended with sugar (corresponding to a dietary intake of carbohydrates). We applied an in vitro biofilm model system that was previously determined to be functionally and taxonomically robust and representative of health-associated dental plaque. The major goal was to characterize critical gene expression mechanisms supporting the understudied pH-recovery stage associated with health. This study provides a solid baseline for defining healthy and disease-like states and highlights the power of moving beyond single and dual species applications to capture key players and their orchestrated metabolic activities within a human oral microbiome model.","study-name":"Gene expression anlayses of saliva-derived in vitro biofilms during carbohydrate fermentation and pH stress","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-02-27T14:48:24"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002264/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002264/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002264/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002264/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002264/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002264/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002264"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002263","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA261560","samples-count":38,"accession":"MGYS00002263","secondary-accession":"SRP047369","centre-name":"BioProject","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Oral microbiology study","study-name":"Saliva of human Targeted Locus (Loci)","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-02-27T14:31:03"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002263/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002263/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002263/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002263/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002263/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002263/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002263"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002262","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA257562","samples-count":2,"accession":"MGYS00002262","secondary-accession":"SRP045295","centre-name":"BioProject","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Quantitative assessment of anti-gingivitis methods based on the microbiota holds great potential yet remains challenging. Although anti-gingivitis efficacy of different oral care products has been studied from clinical outcomes, we know little about their impacts on oral microbiota and its metabolic capabilities. Here, ninety one adults underwent controlled transitions from naturally occurring gingivitis, to healthy gingivae using different anti-gingivitis products. Oral care product regimen, which contains stannous chloride in toothpaste and cetylpyridinium chloride in mouthwash, showed significant better anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis efficacy than placebo toothpaste in twenty seven days parallel study. Microbial diversity for regimen group was significantly decreased from Baseline Day 0 to Day 27. Meanwhile, plaque microbiota structure exhibited a continuous transition along the first principal component, which correlated with changes of Mazza Gingival Index and Plaque Index. Thirteen oral bacteria tend to be affected by two antibacterial activess. Metabonomic analysis of saliva indicates reduced anaerobic fermentation and tissue degradation of oral microbiota. Interestingly, microbial parameters demonstrate the ability to predict treatment effects of different product and regression of gingivitis symptom. Thus, our study provided novel insight into impacts of oral care products on microbial clades and metabolic pathways of gingivitis.","study-name":"Human oral microbiome associated with OC

The effect of such chronic immunosuppression on the microflora at mucosal surfaces is not known. We evaluated the salivary bacterial microbiome of 20 transplant recipients and 19 non-immunosuppressed controls via 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Alpha-diversity and global community structure did not differ between transplant and control subjects. However, principal coordinate analysis showed differences in community membership. Taxa more prevalent in transplant subjects included operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of potentially opportunistic Gammaproteobacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Acinetobacter sp., Vibrio spp., Enterobacteriaceae sp. and the genera Acinetobacter and Klebsiella. Transplant subjects had increased proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacteriaceae sp. and Enterococcus faecalis, among other OTUs, while increased genera included Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. Furthermore, in transplant subjects, the dose of the immunosuppressant prednisone positively correlated with bacterial richness, while prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil doses positively correlated with the prevalence and proportions of transplant-associated taxa. Correlation network analysis of OTU relative abundance revealed a cluster containing potentially opportunistic pathogens as transplant-associated. This cluster positively correlated with serum levels of C-reactive protein, suggesting a link between the resident flora at mucosal compartments and systemic inflammation. Network connectivity analysis revealed opportunistic pathogens as highly connected to each other and to common oral commensals, pointing to bacterial interactions that may influence colonization. This work demonstrates that immunosuppression aimed at limiting T-cell-mediated responses creates a more permissive oral environment for potentially opportunistic pathogens without affecting other members of the salivary bacteriome.","study-name":"Transplantation-associated long-term immunosuppression promotes oral colonization by potentially opportunistic pathogens without impacting other members of the salivary bacteriome","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-02-16T08:37:12"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002246/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002246/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002246/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002246/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002246/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002246/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002246"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002245","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB5215","samples-count":9,"accession":"MGYS00002245","secondary-accession":"ERP004595","centre-name":"UGHENT","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Crosstalk between the human host and its microbiota is reported to influence various diseases such as mucositis. Fundamental research in this area is however complicated by the timeframe restrictions during which microbe-host interactions can be studied in vitro. The model proposed in this paper consists of an oral epithelium and biofilm to study microbe-host crosstalk in vitro in non-infectious conditions up to 72 h. Microbiota derived from oral swabs were cultured on an agar/mucin layer and challenged with monolayers of keratinocytes grown on plastic or collagen type I layers embedded with fibroblasts. The overall microbial biofilm composition in terms of species diversity remained representative for the oral microbiome, whilst the epithelial cell morphology and viability were unaffected. Applying the model to investigate wound healing revealed a reduced healing of 30% in presence of microbiota, which was not caused by a reduction of the proliferation index (52.1–61.5) or a significantly increased number of apoptotic (1-1.13) or necrotic (32-30.5%) cells. Since the model allows the separate study of the microbial and cellular exometabolome, the biofilm and epithelial characteristics after co-culturing, it is applicable for investigations within fundamental research and for the discovery and development of agents that promote wound healing.","study-name":"Development of an oral mucosa model to study host-microbiome interactions during wound healing","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-02-16T08:34:18"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002243","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA269493","samples-count":223,"accession":"MGYS00002243","secondary-accession":"SRP050998","centre-name":"BioProject","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"No studies to date have examined the relationship within an individual between bacterial communities along sites of the upper aerodigestive tract.

Reduced saliva flow may lead to changes in the salivary microbiota. These changes have mainly been studied with culture that typically recovers only 65% of the bacteria present.\n\nObjective: This study was to use high throughput sequencing, covering both cultivated and not-yet-cultivated bacteria, to assess the bacterial microbiota of whole saliva in pSS patients with normal salivation.\n\nMethods: Bacteria of whole unstimulated saliva from nine pSS patients with normal salivation flow and from nine healthy controls were examined by high throughput sequencing of the hypervariable region V1V2 of 16S rRNA using the 454 GS Junior system. Raw sequence reads were subjected to a species-level, reference-based taxonomy assignment pipeline specially designed for studying the human oral microbial community. Each of the sequence reads was BLASTN-searched against a database consisting of reference sequences representing 1,156 oral and 12,013 non-oral species. Unassigned reads were then screened for high-quality non-chimeras and subjected to de novo species-level operational taxonomy unit (OTU) calling for potential novel species. Downstream analyses, including alpha and beta diversities, were analyzed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. To reveal significant differences between the microbiota of control saliva and Sjögren's saliva, a statistical method introduced in Metastats www.metastats.cbcb.umd.edu was used.\n\nResults: Saliva of pSS patients with normal salivation had a significantly higher frequency of Firmicutes compared with controls (p=0.004). Two other major phyla, Synergistetes and Spirochaetes, were significantly depleted in pSS (p=0.001 for both). In addition, we saw a nearly 17% decrease in the number of genera in pSS (25 vs. 30). While Prevotella was almost equally abundant in both groups (25% in pSS and 22% in controls), about a twofold increase in pSS of Streptococcus (28% vs. 17%) and Veillonella (26% vs. 12%) was detected. Prevotella melaninogenica was the major species in controls (13%) while Veillonella atypica and the Veillonella parvula groups dominated in patient samples (14 and 14%). The scarcity in bacterial species in pSS compared with controls was also demonstrated by alpha and beta diversity analyses, as well as read abundance depicted in a phylogenetic tree.\n\nConclusions: While Firmicutes was significantly higher in pSS patients than in controls, Synergistetes and Spirochaetes were significantly lower. The number of bacterial genera and species was also lower. These data showed that microbial dysbiosis is another key characteristic of pSS whole saliva which can occur independent of hyposalivation.","study-name":"MICROBIOLOGICAL AND BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY SJOGREN'S SYNDROME PATIENTS WITH NORMAL SALIVATION","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-02-15T08:31:00"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002240","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA388322","samples-count":4,"accession":"MGYS00002240","secondary-accession":"SRP108566","centre-name":"BioProject","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"The goals of this study is to expose the relevance between environmental microbiome and microbiome from human oral and gut","study-name":"16S rDNA sequences of human oral and gut microbiome Raw sequence reads","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-02-15T08:28:32"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002240/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002240/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002240/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002240/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002240/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002240/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002240"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002239","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB13941","samples-count":1,"accession":"MGYS00002239","secondary-accession":"ERP015528","centre-name":"FISABIO - Public Health","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Salivary markers of oxidative stress are associated with periodontal status and are altered in patients with periodontitis or caries.

These infections are polymicrobial with high bacterial diversity.  Understanding the spatial transition of microbiota from normal oral cavities through the infected root canal to the acute periapical abscess can improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of endodontic infections and lead to more effective treatment. We obtained samples from the oral cavity, infected root canal and periapical abscess of 8 patients (5 with localized and 3 with systemic infections). Microbial populations in these samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. Bioinformatics tools and statistical tests with rigorous criteria were used to elucidate the spatial transition of the microbiota from normal to diseased sites. Results: On average, 10,000 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from each sample.  All sequences fell into 11 different bacterial phyla.  The microbial diversity in root canal and abscess samples was significantly lower than in the oral samples.  Streptococcus was the most abundant genus in oral cavities while Prevotella and Fusobacterium were most abundant in diseased samples.  Root canal and periapical abscess microbiota were more similar to each other than to the oral cavity microbiota. Using rigorous criteria and novel bioinformatics tools, we found that Granulicatella adiacens, Eubacterium yurii, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella salivae, Streptococcus mitis, and Atopobium rimae were over-represented in diseased samples.  Conclusions: We used a novel approach and high-throughput methodologies to describe microbial transition from normal to diseased oral sites in the same individuals    Eight patients with root canal infections (5 with systemic infections and 3 with localized infection) undergone treatment. Samples were obtained from three sampling sites in each patient. Oral (OS): samples collected from the subjects by rubbing 3 fine paper points against patient''s cheek mucosa, lateral boarder of the tongue and supragingival plaque at the contra lateral side away from the affected tooth. Root Canal (RC): samples collected from the root canal space of the diseased tooth using 3 fine paper points.

However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem, which may affect our ability to discover disease-associated biomarkers. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then sequenced the salivary and buccal mucosa bacterial communities of five healthy subjects to investigate their diversity and differences within and between subjects. Mock community analysis revealed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities revealed 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) across all samples with only 78 of the OTUs present in all subjects. Salivary communities were more diverse, with 120-318 OTUs per subject, while in mucosa each subject had 63-136 OTUs. Total OTUs per subject estimated using CatchAll (an estimator that performed well in evenly distributed salivary and also in uneven mucosal communities), ranged from 145-369 for saliva and 111-377 for mucosa. Inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident even at very low sequencing depths and were mainly explained by an over-representation of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa, while several taxa from the genera Neisseria, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, among others, showed higher affinity for saliva. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate the design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies of the oral flora. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for the evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.","study-name":"Using High Throughput Sequencing to Understand the Biodiversity of Oral Bacterial Communities","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-02-14T13:01:50"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002214/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002214/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002214/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002214/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002214/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002214/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002214"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002213","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA73017","samples-count":76,"accession":"MGYS00002213","secondary-accession":"SRP008130","centre-name":"Yale University","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare the oral microbial profiles in community dwelling adults with those residing in healthcare environments that are known to have high epidemiologic risk for pneumonia (i.e., nursing home residents, and mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units).

The management of chronic periodontitis (CP) relies heavily on elimination or at least control of known pathogenic consortia associated with the disease. Until now, microbial plaque obtained from the subgingival (SubG) sites has been the primary focus for bacterial community analysis using deep-sequencing. In addition to the use of SubG plaque, here we investigated whether plaque obtained from supragingival (SupG) and tongue dorsum sites can serve as alternatives for monitoring CP-associated bacterial biomarkers. Using SubG, SupG, and tongue plaque DNA from 11 healthy and 13 diseased subjects, we sequenced V3 regions (~200 bases) of the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina sequencing. For the first time, this study demonstrates that SupG and tongue dorsum plaque can serve as alternative sources for detecting and enumerating known and novel bacterial biomarkers of CP. This finding is clinically important because, in contrast with SubG sampling that requires trained professionals, obtaining plaque from SupG and tongue sites is convenient, minimally-invasive, and offers a novel means to track CP-biomarker organisms during treatment outcome monitoring.","study-name":"Community structure analysis in chronic periodontitis and novel oral sampling sites for detecting disease indicators","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-02-05T09:54:27"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002188/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002188/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002188/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002188/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002188/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002188/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002188"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002187","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA383868","samples-count":540,"accession":"MGYS00002187","secondary-accession":"SRP104798","centre-name":"BioProject","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"The development of dental caries in children provides a disease model that is well suited to a metagenomic investigation since the timeframe of caries development can be monitored within a defined study period during which longitudinal studies can be conducted.

Our study endeavors to define the relative abundance of many species comprising the dental plaque microbiome in twin pairs discordant for dental caries in association and longitudinal studies. The study power afforded by the use of discordant twin pairs for dental caries is substantially greater than similar studies using unrelated individuals. Next, we will compare the caries-free and caries-active microbiomes by deep metagenomic sequencing to identify differentially abundant genes and metabolic pathways. Lastly, we will determine the functional relevance of differentially abundant species, strains and genes by conducting targeted meta-transcriptomic studies. The statistical significance of all of the datasets will be determined which will allow for the widespread identification of species, strains, genes and transcripts associated with dental caries and dental health. These approaches are likely to enhance our understanding of dental caries onset and development and may enable in the future the development of novel treatment strategies.","study-name":"Metagenomics of the Microbiome in Oral Health and Disease","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-02-05T09:43:01"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002187/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002187/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002187/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002187/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002187/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002187/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002187"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002186","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJNA227796","samples-count":14,"accession":"MGYS00002186","secondary-accession":"SRP033022","centre-name":"BioProject","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"16S rRNA sequencing of the saliva microbiome of healthy human adult individuals","study-name":"Human Saliva Microbiome","data-origination":"HARVESTED","last-update":"2018-02-05T09:07:47"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002186/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002186/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002186/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002186/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002186/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002186/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002186"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002184","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB19825","samples-count":1968,"accession":"MGYS00002184","secondary-accession":"ERP021896","centre-name":"UCSDMI","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Understanding the normal temporal variation in the human microbiome is critical to developing treatments for putative microbiome-related afflictions such as obesity, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and malnutrition. Sequencing and computational technologies however have been a limiting factor in performing dense timeseries analysis of the human microbiome. Here we present the largest human microbiota timeseries analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints. Results: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, daily fluctuations in an individual's microbiota appear characteristic. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total within body site microbial communities appears to be present across all time points, suggesting that if a core temporal microbiome exists it is small. Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members. DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals. This capacity will allow us to define normal variation and pathologic states, and for assessing responses to therapeutic interventions.","study-name":"Moving pictures of the human microbiome","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-01-31T09:01:27"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002184/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002184/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002184/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002184/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002184/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002184/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}},{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral"}},{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Skin","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Skin"}}],"meta":{"count":3}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002184"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002180","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB24494","samples-count":2,"accession":"MGYS00002180","secondary-accession":"ERP106323","centre-name":"SAHMRI","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Determining the effects of antimicrobial therapies on airway microbiology at a population-level is essential. Such analysis allows, for example, surveillance of antibiotic-induced changes in pathogen prevalence, the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, and the transmission of multi-resistant organisms. However, current analytical strategies for understanding these processes are limited. Culture- and PCR-based assays for specific microbes require the a priori selection of targets, while antibiotic sensitivity testing typically provides no insight into either the molecular basis of resistance, or the carriage of resistance determinants by the wider commensal microbiota. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing provides an alternative approach that allows the microbial composition of clinical samples to be described in detail, including the prevalence of resistance genes and virulence traits. While highly informative, the application of metagenomics to large patient cohorts can be prohibitively expensive. Using sputum samples from a randomised placebo-controlled trial of erythromycin in adults with bronchiectasis, we describe a novel, cost-effective strategy for screening patient cohorts for changes in resistance gene prevalence. By combining metagenomic screening of pooled DNA extracts with validatory quantitative PCR-based analysis of candidate markers in individual samples, we identify population-level changes in the relative abundance of specific macrolide resistance genes. This approach has the potential to provide an important adjunct to current analytical strategies, particularly within the context of antimicrobial clinical trials.","study-name":"sputum from patients

With advances in sequencing technologies comprehensive studies to elucidate bacterial community differences have recently become possible. We used 454 sequencing of 16S rDNA to compare subgingival bacterial communities from 29 periodontally healthy controls and 29 subjects with chronic periodontitis. Amplicons from both the V1-2 and V4 regions of the 16S gene were sequenced, yielding 1,393,579 sequences. They were identified by BLAST against a curated oral 16S database, and mapped to 16 phyla, 106 genera, and 596 species. 81% of sequences could be mapped to cultivated species. Differences between health- and periodontitis-associated bacterial communities were observed at all phylogenetic levels, and UniFrac and PCoA showed distinct community profiles in health and disease. Community diversity was higher in disease, and 123 species were identified that were significantly more abundant in disease, and 53 in health. Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, and Bacteroidetes were more abundant in disease, while the Proteobacteria were found at higher levels in healthy controls. Within the phylum Firmicutes, the class Bacilli was health-associated, while the Clostridia, Negativicutes, and Erysipelotrichia were associated with disease. These results implicate a number of taxa that will be targets for future research. Some, such as Filifactor alocis and many spirochetes were represented by a large fraction of sequences as compared to previously identified targets.

The effects of yoga or LFD intervention on the gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome was examined for correlations between both treatment options.Methods: Fifty-nine patients with IBS undertook a single-blind, randomized controlled trial involving a yoga or LFD intervention. Bacterial abundance was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at baseline and after 12 weeks using operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Results: LFD resulted in reduction of the overall relative abundance of Firmicutes, especially of the genus Blautia. This was matched by an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This observation appears also as a weak, but not statistically significant trend in the yoga group. Few OTUs showed a similar response to yoga and LFD. The most pronounced was a decrease observed in the family Lachnospiraceae, namely Eubacterium hallii, Blautia wexlerae and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans.Conclusions: This study suggests that both, yoga and LFD can change the microbiota for some OTUs in a similar way. The reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes in LFD might unfold its effects through a direct change in the gut bacteria composition. In constrast, yoga might indirectly act on the microbiome through the parasympathetic nervous system, which paralleled the effects of LFD for some Lachnospiraceae species. The underlying mechanism of both interventions are open for future research.","study-name":"Effect of Yoga and low-FODMAP diet in the intestinal microbiota of patients with IBS","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2018-01-18T14:24:21"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002138/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002138/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002138/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002138/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002138/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002138/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002138"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00002111","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB24289","samples-count":19,"accession":"MGYS00002111","secondary-accession":"ERP106100","centre-name":"PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"We report BK Polyomavirus genome sequences assembled from shotgun metagenomic sequencing data of patient urine samples previously tested for urinary tract infection.

The skin microbiome is thought to play important roles in skin defence and immune functioning.  Diabetes affects the skin environment, and this may perturb skin microbiome with possible implications for skin infections and wound healing.  This study examines the skin and wound microbiome in type II diabetes. Results: Ten type II diabetic subjects with chronic foot ulcers were followed over a time course of 10 weeks, sampling from both foot skin (swabs) and wounds (swabs and debrided tissue) every two weeks. A control group of 8 non-diabetic subjects was also followed over 10 weeks, and skin swabs collected from the foot skin every two weeks.  The diabetic skin microbiome was significantly less diverse than non-diabetic skin.  Community composition was also significantly different between diabetic and non-diabetic skin, however the most abundant taxa were similar between groups, with differences driven by very low abundant members of the skin communities. Chronic wounds were generally colonized by the most dominant skin Staphylococcus, along with other taxa that generally different by patient. No significant correlations were found between wound duration or healing status and the abundance of any particular taxa, while wound size was positively correlated with the dominant skin Staphylococcus.   Conclusions: The major difference observed in this study of the skin microbiome associated with diabetes was a significant reduction in diversity.

In this study, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and two different bioinformatics approaches, to investigate possible changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in samples from patients with STEC infection compared to healthy and healed controls, collected during an outbreak caused by a STEC O26:H11 infection. Regardless of the bioinformatic procedure used, a good resolution of the taxonomic profiles of the samples was achieved. The faeces collected from the STEC infected patients showed a lower intestinal abundance of the beneficial microorganisms Bifidobacterium and Clostridiales spp. in comparison to controls where those microorganisms predominated. These differences were observed with both bioinformatic approaches used and seemed to be related with the STEC infection although the variation in the relative abundance of the members of the Bifidobacterium genus could have also been associated with the dysbiotic status following the diarrhoea.Finally, the metagenomic sequencing allowed to identify in the STEC positive samples, all the virulence traits present in the genomes of the STEC O26 that caused the outbreak. The results shown represent a first evidence of the changes occurring in the intestinal microbiota of children in the course of STEC infection and indicate that metagenomics may be a promising tool for the culture-independent clinical diagnosis of the infection.","study-name":"Metagenomic characterization of the human intestinal microbiota in faecal samples from STEC-infected patients","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2017-11-03T09:27:12"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001991/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001991/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001991/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001991/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001991/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001991/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001991"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00001988","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB22359","samples-count":253,"accession":"MGYS00001988","secondary-accession":"ERP104038","centre-name":"EMG","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"The cholera_succession Third Party Annotation (TPA) assembly was derived from the primary whole genome shotgun (WGS) data set PRJEB9150.

 Background: The use of an endotracheal tube may influence the tracheal  microbiota compositions of ventilator patients which may be the leading cause of mortality in hospital intensive care units. Our primary objective is totrack the diversity and dynamics of bacterial communities within or between the patients, and to determine whether antibiotic therapy and adrenal corticosteroids treatment might influence the harbor of human bacterial pathogens..  Methods: The samples were obtained from eight patients of ventilator with endotracheal tube from Peking University People's Hospital in Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) during a period of 15 days. The microbiota of tracheal aspirates samples from day0, 1, 3, 5,7,10 and 14 were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing. The primers: 341F and 805R, complemented with 454 adapters and sample specific barcodes were used for PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA genes.   Results: Analysis of 736,495 high-quality sequences (92,061 reads per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. The composition of microbiota species were significantly distinguished between the day0 and the day14 of tracheal aspirate samples (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). On the individual basis, the microbiota was, however, relatively stable over time. Treatment with antibiotics and adrenal corticosteroids indeed influenced the global composition of the microbiota. CONCLUSION: These results support the phenomenon of dynamics diversification of airway microbiota  in ventilated patients with tracheal intubation. Antibiotics and adrenal corticosteroids therapy may contribute to the alternation of microbiota.","study-name":"Dynamics tracheal intubation airway microbiota of ventilated patients at continuous time points via metagenomic sequencing","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2017-06-20T14:22:17"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001832/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001832/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001832/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001832/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001832/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001832/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory system:Pulmonary system","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory%20system:Pulmonary%20system"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001832"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00001818","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB20777","samples-count":204,"accession":"MGYS00001818","secondary-accession":"ERP022958","centre-name":"LSHTM","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Microgravity induces physiological deconditioning due to the absence of gravity loading, resulting in bone mineral density loss, atrophy of lower limb skeletal and postural muscles, and lengthening of the spine. SkinSuit is a lightweight compression suit designed to provide head-to-foot (axial) loading to counteract spinal elongation during spaceflight. As synthetic garments may impact negatively on the skin microbiome, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon procedures to define bacterial skin communities at sebaceous and moist body sites of five healthy male volunteers undergoing SkinSuit evaluation. Each volunteer displayed a diverse, distinct bacterial population at each skin site. Short (8 h) periods of dry hyper-buoyancy flotation wearing either gym kit or SkinSuit elicited changes in the composition of the skin microbiota at the genus level but had little or no impact on community structure at the phylum level or the richness and diversity of the bacterial population. We also determined the composition of the skin microbiota of an astronaut during pre-flight training, during an eight-day visit to the International Space Station involving two 8 h periods of SkinSuit wear, and for one month after return. Changes in composition of bacterial skin communities at five body sites were strongly linked to changes in geographical location. A distinct ISS microbiome signature was found which reversed to a pre-flight profile on return. No changes in microbiome complexity or diversity were noted, with little evidence for colonisation by potentially pathogenic bacteria.

The impact of probiotic-supplemented infant formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well defined. Objective:To determine the effect of a bifidobacteria-containing formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome during the first year of life.Design: Double-blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled study with newborn infants assigned to a standard whey-based formula containing a total of 10(8) cfu/g of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. longum, B. longum subsp. infantis (intervention), or to control formula without bifidobacteria (placebo). Breast-fed controls were included. Diversity and composition of fecal microbiota were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolite profiles were analysed by UHP-LC mass spectrometry over a period of two years. Results: One hundred six infants were randomized to the interventional (n=48) or placebo (n=49) group; 9 infants were solely breast-fed throughout the entire intervention period of 12 months. Infants exposed to bifidobacteria-supplemented formula showed decreased occurrence of Bacteroides and Blautia spp. associated  with changes in lipids and unknown metabolites at month 1. Microbiota and metabolite profiles converged during the intervention period and long-term colonization (24 months) of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strains was not detected.

However, a placebo-controlled dietary advice study has not been conducted and the diet leads to a potentially detrimental shift in microbiota composition.Methods: A 2x2 factorial trial was undertaken in the tertiary care setting. Patients aged 18-65 years with Rome III IBS were recruited. Patients were randomised 1:1 for four weeks to a diet (sham diet vs LFD) and supplement (placebo vs probiotic), resulting in four different groups. The sham diet was equivalent in dietary restriction compared with LFD. The probiotic was multistrain (VSL#3). Patients were masked to the interventions. The primary endpoints were adequate relief of symptoms and stool Bifidobacteria abundance at four weeks. Results: 104 patients were randomised. 27 were allocated to sham diet/placebo, 26 to sham diet/probiotic, 24 to LFD/placebo and 27 to LFD/probiotic. There was no interaction between the interventions. In the intention-to-treat analysis, adequate symptom relief was higher for LFD (57%) versus sham (38%), although did not reach statistical significance (p=0.051), whereas in the per protocol analysis the higher proportion for LFD (61%) versus sham (39%) was statistically significant (p=0.043). Bifidobacteria were lower after LFD versus sham (8.8 vs 9.2 16S rRNA genes/g, p=0.008) and higher after probiotic versus placebo (p=0.019). There was no effect of LFD on microbiota diversity.Conclusions: This is the first placebo-controlled study of LFD advice in IBS, reporting adequate symptom relief that approached significance together with significantly reduced symptom scores compared with placebo.

It is important to develop approaches to accurately and rapidly diagnose the types and stages of respiratory disease.  Many approaches are focusing on such as serum or sputum as the basis of a screening programme. Many biomolecules found within human saliva have their origins in the circulatory system and thus, saliva offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for a number of diseases.  In this study, we assessed how far saliva could be used to reveal key changes. In particular, we have used metabolomics whereby the chemical components of a sample (1000s of biochemicals) can be accurately quantified in a matter of minutes – to assess salvia samples from 93 samples. Saliva has also been used as a biofluid for metabolomics previously used to identify specific oral, breast and pancreatic cancer profilesThe sampled population encompassed 53 COPD patients from Prince Phillip, Gwangli and Bronglais Hospitals in the Hywel Dda Health Board Area. These consisted of 38 age-matched volunteer controls, 8 lung cancer patients and 18 with a range of respiratory diseases.  The samples consisting of 50 L of saliva were analysed using metabolomic approaches involving the use of Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (FIE-MS) to produce a large dataset 169 samples x 6500 metabolites.  Application of “multivariate” statistical approaches allowed the identification of metabolites that are different in particular sample classes.   Using statistically approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we demonstrate that saliva could distinguish between samples from each clinical classification compared to controls.  These results were validated using a cross-validated Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which indicated a diagnostic accuracy of > 0.70. Individual chemicals which are the sources of variation between the sample sets have been identified. Further, we have discovered clear differences in the saliva metabolome of COPD patients at different disease severity as defined by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage classification.  Therefore, this innovative application of “big-data” based analyses has yield potential biomarkers that could be exploited to inform future clinical practice.","study-name":"Clinical study of saliva metabolomics and microbiomics in respiratory diseases","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2017-05-23T16:30:13"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001766/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001766/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001766/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001766/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001766/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001766/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001766"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00001748","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB6358","samples-count":768,"accession":"MGYS00001748","secondary-accession":"ERP005883","centre-name":"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR GENOME SCIENCES","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"Given the global burden of diarrheal diseases, it is important to understand how members of the gut microbiota affect the risk for, the course of, and recovery from disease.  This is true for young children when the gut microbiota is being assembled, as well as for adults.  Recent culture-independent analyses of the fecal microbiota of healthy Bangladeshi infants and children, sampled monthly from birth through the second year of life, have identified a group of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa that together define a normal program of postnatal development (maturation) of the gut microbiota. The acute voluminous diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption.  We have conducted a detailed time-series metagenomic study of the fecal microbiota during the acute diarrheal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a very high burden of disease. Recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that mirrors the normal pattern of assembly/maturation of the microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children. To define underlying mechanisms, we created an artificial community of 14 sequenced human gut bacterial species in gnotobiotic mice, composed of taxa that directly correlate with recovery from cholera and that are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children. One of these age-discriminatory species, Ruminococcus obeum, exhibited consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. cholerae infection of the mice. Follow-up mono- and bi-colonization studies established that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization. RNA-Seq of the community's meta-transcriptome, combined with assays of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and function, revealed that expression of R. obeum luxS (AI-2 synthase) and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing mediated repression of toxin co-regulated pilus, a primary V. cholerae colonization factor. Co-colonization experiments in gnotobiotic mice established that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the canonical V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP.","study-name":"Effects of cholera on the human gut microbiota, and interactions between human gut microbes and Vibrio cholerae.","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2017-05-16T16:42:01"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00001745","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB20665","samples-count":642,"accession":"MGYS00001745","secondary-accession":"ERP022836","centre-name":"GUH","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"We explored bacterial community diversity of supraglottic secretions, endotracheal apirate and broncho-alveolar lavage from intubated patients hospitalised in the intensive care unit.","study-name":"Ventilator-associated pneumonia","data-origination":"SUBMITTED","last-update":"2017-05-11T11:04:18"},"relationships":{"publications":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001745/publications"}},"downloads":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001745/downloads"}},"geocoordinates":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001745/geocoordinates"}},"samples":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001745/samples"}},"analyses":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001745/analyses"}},"biomes":{"links":{"related":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001745/biomes"},"data":[{"type":"biomes","id":"root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory system:Pulmonary system","links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory%20system:Pulmonary%20system"}}],"meta":{"count":1}}},"links":{"self":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001745"}},{"type":"studies","id":"MGYS00001728","attributes":{"bioproject":"PRJEB20595","samples-count":4,"accession":"MGYS00001728","secondary-accession":"ERP022764","centre-name":"GUH","is-public":true,"public-release-date":null,"study-abstract":"A clinical examination of a patient pointed to a hepatic brucelloma.

The functional capacity of the COPD lung microbiome indicated an increased capacity for bacterial growth, which could be an important feature in bacterial-associated acute exacerbations. Regression analyses correlated COPD severity (FEV1 % of predicted) with differences in the abundance of Streptococcus pneumonia and functional classifications related to a reduced capacity for bacterial sialic acid metabolism.
